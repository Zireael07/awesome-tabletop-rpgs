## FAQ

Q: I like \< insert name of a commercial system \>, are there free/open alternatives that I can hack?
A: Sure, for many of those alternatives exist. Look in the quickstart category first, many of those are OGL.

Alternatively, try the following ideas:
- if you like **Cortex Prime**, try the Polyhedral FATE variant
- If you like Genesys or Star Wars FFG, try the Destiny Dice
- If you like SilCore, try Jovian Despair
