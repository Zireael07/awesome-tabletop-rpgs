## Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Keep in mind this is an **awesome** list, not any piece of crap you find
- All links must be relevant, tested and well described
- Mark commercial products, including the street price, if possible
  - :moneybag: = tens of dollars
  - :moneybag::moneybag: = hundreds of dollars
  - :moneybag::moneybag::moneybag: = thousands of dollars
- For any commercial product inserted, make sure you add free/open source alternatives
- Open source links should include the license in brackets i.e. (MIT)

Thank you for your suggestions!

## If we ask you to update your Pull Request

A lot of times, making a Pull Request adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your Pull Request before we merge it. There's no need to open a new Pull Request, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your Pull Request so that we can merge it.
